Key points for Vite:

Port 5173: Vite's default dev server port
--host flag: Required for the dev server to be accessible outside the container (otherwise it only binds to localhost inside the container)

Important: Make sure your vite.config.js allows external access. If you have issues, add this to your config:
export default {
  server: {
    host: true,
    port: 5173
  }
}

Then you can run it with:
docker build -t my-react-app .
docker run -p 5173:5173 my-react-app

And access it at http://localhost:5173
For development with hot-reloading, you might also want to add a volume mount:
docker run -p 5173:5173 -v $(pwd):/app -v /app/node_modules my-react-app

Production setup (multi-stage with nginx):
FROM node:22-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

Creates optimized, minified static files
Serves them with nginx (fast, efficient)
No hot-reloading: You need to rebuild the Docker image every time you change code
Better for testing "production-like" behavior

For learning/education:

If you're actively coding and want to see changes instantly → use dev server (single-stage)
If you want to see how it works in production → use nginx (multi-stage)
